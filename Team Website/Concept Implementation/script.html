The users enter a completely white room with nothing in it but an array of 15 schoolhouse desks, all facing a TV screen at the front of the room. After they get settled, the TV powers on automatically and starts playing what seems to be an educational video about deep space and a man’s voice narrates…
                    </p>
                    <p>
“Have you ever looked into the night sky and lost yourself in the sea of stars? The universe, in terms of our own comprehension, is nearly infinite. Other than our magnificent sun, the closest star to us, Proxima Centauri, is more than 4 lightyears away. That means that, travelling at the speed of light, it’ll take you more than four years to reach that star. Imagine how far you could travel on a 4-year-long road trip. You might be able to drive around the world! Well, at the speed of light, you could travel around the world 7 and a half times in ONE SECOND. So that closest star, Proxima Centauri, is a long, long way away. With so much sprawling space in the universe, how could life not exist in at least one other place?
                    </p>
                    <p>
“It does, and we’ve known about it for the past few decades.
                    </p>
                    <p>
“Over these decades, the world’s leaders have agreed to join into the governing body whose jurisdiction encompasses all intergalactic life. This government has remained secret to the public of all the worlds whose inhabitants are not deemed ready to learn the truth. And now, Earthlings, it is your turn to learn the truth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
“The Council of Galaxies, as the government is called, runs an intergalactic law enforcement force. One specific faction of this force is called the Time Elite Squad. And in the current state of emergency, you are its newest recruits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
“As the chief of the Time Elite Squad, I welcome you to the greatest league of intergalactic law enforcers, set to travel through space and time. We do not bother ourselves with small matters within each individual world, but rather with violations of the interplanetary code, including, but not limited to, death star construction, intent to blow up another planet, or interplanetary invasions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
“Part of the interplanetary code is that a squad of Time Elite members assigned to protect a particular planet must consist of lifeforms indigenous to that planet. That is why you have been chosen as our newest recruits. Danger is approaching Earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
“We at headquarters have just received word that, in the future, the Karblaxian race that resides deep within the Andromeda galaxy plans an invasion of Earth to begin in early 2436. The Karblaxians are a curious race, always looking to advance the cutting edge of science and technology. But they are also a very proud race, obsessed with revenge. On August 9th of 2435, one of your fellow humans, exploring a specific quadrant of Andromeda will accidentally kill the son of a Karblaxian king while testing out a new, radioactive world-mapping device.
                    </p>
                    <p>
“The way I see it, you have two options. You can go into the future to prevent your human explorer from killing that innocent Karblaxian. Or you can go back into the past, to July 21st, 1969 where you first made contact with the Karblaxian race. That was when that Apollo 11 contraption of yours landed on your puny little moon. Either way you decide, you must find a way to complete your tasks without anyone knowing you were ever there. All Time Elite rookies are forbidden from personal interactions with inhabitants of different timelines. That is of the utmost importance. So will you venture into the future, or journey back to the past? The choice is yours. I’ll send you a fax of the specific dates where you can make a difference and save your planet. Now, go on into the time chamber, choose your path, and it’ll send you where and when you need to be.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
[A fax prints out in old school fax-y letters containing two specific dates, a key depicting three colors with each representing either day, year or month, and a strange code meant for deciphering a foreign language used to represent dates]
                    </p>
                    <p>
The users take the fax with the specific dates and advance to the next room, which acts as a time machine. There are three identical contraptions mounted on the walls of this circular room, and they sort of resemble the steering wheel of a clipper ship, each is lit up in a different color and contains a series of rings with strange symbols on them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
This is where the users must decide if they want to go into the future or the past. Whichever of the users holds the faxed key to the code will call out to other members which color represents which aspect of the date (date, month or year) to which they’d like to travel. Then that user can also describe the arrangement of strange symbols to represent a specific date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Upon placing each of the three series of rings in the correct configuration, the wheels will flash and a door will be unlocked either to the past or the future, where the users will advance and set out to save our planet and prevent the Karblaxian invasion.
