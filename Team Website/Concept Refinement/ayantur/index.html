                <h1>Ayantu Regassa</h1>
                <p>This model is a works-like model of the time selection device for the time travel room. The concept is reletively simple. There are two stacked cyliders that can be rotated individually but rotate together much like the hands of a clock. The model consists of a three gear mechanism (shown in the image below), which allows the manual rotation of one of the cylinders to drive the rotation of the second cylinder.</p>

                <p>The cyliders themsleves are mounted so that the larger cylinder is attached to the outer ring gear while the smaller one is mounted to the central gear. The middle gear serves to transfer the rotational motion to the the inner gear.</p>
                <p>Originally we had planned on having a four gear system that would allow the the two cylinders to rotate in the same directions but at different speeds. However, the rotational direction of the second (smaller) cylinder was deemed to not be critical so we chose to go with a simpler, three gear model.</p>
                <img src="../storyboard/images/sketch_model_pics/ayantu1.JPG" class="model_img">
                <p> Though the works-like model (shown above) works in the general sense, there are still some details that need to be worked out. One of these details being the gear ratio. The plan is to have the smaller cylinder spin at 5 times the rate of the the larger, outer cylinder. This will be implimented in the next itteration of models. <br> Having tested the model's function, we've found that the mounting of the gears and how they are attached to the cylinders is very critical. We had to make several modifications to the gear-to-cylinder attachment in order to make sure the gears rotated freely. However, more adjustments still need to be made to make sure they rotate smoothly with little to no noise.</p>
